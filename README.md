#ðŸ“˜ Student Report Card Generator (Rust)

A simple Rust-based console application that:

âœ… Collects a student's name, total marks, and number of subjects  
âœ… Calculates the average  
âœ… Assigns a grade based on the average  
âœ… Generates a neat **PDF report card**

## Features

- Command-line user input (student data)
- Custom methods for:
  - Average calculation
  - Grade assignment (A/B/C/D)
- PDF generation using the [`genpdf`](https://crates.io/crates/genpdf) crate

| 90 and above  | A      |
| 75â€“89         | B      |
| 60â€“74         | C      |
